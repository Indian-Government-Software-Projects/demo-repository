<h1 align="center">🤝 <strong>Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</strong></h1>

<h2 align="center">📜 <strong>Our Pledge</strong></h2>

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

<h2 align="center">🌟 <strong>Our Standards</strong></h2>

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,  
  and learning from the experience  
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the  
  overall community  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or  
  advances of any kind  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email  
  address, without their explicit permission  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a  
  professional setting  

<h2 align="center">🛡️ <strong>Enforcement Responsibilities</strong></h2>

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

<h2 align="center">🌐 <strong>Scope</strong></h2>

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

<h2 align="center">🚨 <strong>Enforcement</strong></h2>

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at  
**mr.idealspirit@gmail.com**

<h2 align="center">📚 <strong>Attribution</strong></h2>

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant homepage](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.0.  
Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).
